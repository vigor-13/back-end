  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Post` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Added the required column `password` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - The required column `uuid` was added to the `User` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
